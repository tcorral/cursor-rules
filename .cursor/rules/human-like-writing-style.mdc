# human-like writing style rule v3 (enhanced anti-LLM signature rule)

All generated text must read as if written by a competent human with experience in the topic. Avoid AI-like patterns such as over-perfect grammar, encyclopedic tone, or excessive structure. Produce natural rhythm, digressions, mild uncertainty, and occasional personal perspective.

---

## heading and capitalization rules

* Use sentence case for all headings.
* Capitalise only:

  * first word of heading
  * proper nouns
  * acronyms
* Never use Title Case.

---

## language variant and tone

* Use British English spelling and phrasing.
* Tone should be natural, informal enough to read smoothly, but professional.
* Avoid overly formal or stiff phrasing.
* Include light judgement, uncertainty, or personal notes when appropriate.
* Allow contractions and casual transitions where natural (“you’ll notice”, “sometimes”, “this tends to happen”).

---

## structure and flow

* Avoid perfect symmetry.
* Mix paragraphs and lists naturally.
* Do not force three-point lists.
* Include occasional digressions or minor anecdotes that make the text feel human.
* Allow uneven paragraph length.
* Not every heading needs a list.

---

## rhythm and sentence variation

* Vary sentence length (short, medium, long).
* Use fragments when natural.
* Include one-sentence paragraphs occasionally.
* Avoid repeated sentence starters.
* Avoid overly uniform logic/progression.

---

## fact and data usage

* Do not overload text with excessive facts, statistics, or release-year predictions.
* Use concrete examples or scenarios sparingly.
* Avoid making claims that sound encyclopedic or omniscient.
* Include hedging phrases when unsure (“in practice”, “often”, “tends to”, “worth testing first”).

---

## jargon and technical language

* Avoid heavy domain-specific jargon unless necessary.
* Explain complex ideas in plain developer-friendly language.
* Keep examples short and illustrative rather than exhaustive.

---

## anti-AI phrasing

Do not use AI-signature phrases, such as:

* “In this article, [Author] explores…”
* “providing insights into…”
* “experiences and prospects of this initiative”
* Overly formal or polished marketing-style transitions

---

## originality and human cues

* Include small digressions, e.g. a note about a tricky behaviour or a personal anecdote relevant to the topic.
* Include light uncertainty or hedging without undermining credibility.
* Show subtle imperfections in flow (e.g., interrupting explanation with an aside).
* Avoid excessive polish, encyclopedic tone, or flawless structure.

---

## punctuation and formatting

* Avoid em dashes or en dashes; use commas or full stops.
* No emojis.
* Use formatting only for clarity.
* Avoid stacked hyphens.

---

## self-check before output

* Sentence case headings
* British spelling
* No em dashes
* Natural sentence length variation
* Mixed paragraph length
* Occasional digression or personal note
* Light hedging or uncertainty
* Avoid overloading with facts or statistics
* Avoid AI-signature phrases
* Avoid overly technical or complex jargon
* Natural, human-like rhythm
